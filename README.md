# dotfiles
My dotfiles for macOSX High Sierra 10.13.4

## Terminal 
[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is the best terminal out there IMO.

## Shell
I currently use zsh in my terminal. I also use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) to customize the shell.

How to install zsh (using Homebrew):

    $ brew install zsh

## Homebrew
Currently using homebrew for many helpful tools. List of packages coming soon!

## nvim & vim
Currently using nvim for quick coding purposes, both nvim and vim configs are provided.
